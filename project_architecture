# Explanation of Files

## `dataflow/`

### `main.py`
This file contains the Python code defining the Dataflow pipeline. It includes logic for reading messages from Google Cloud Pub/Sub, performing sentiment analysis using the Natural Language API, and processing the results.

### `requirements.txt`
This file lists the Python package requirements specific to the Dataflow component of the project.

## `pubsub/`

### `publisher.py`
This file contains the Python code for publishing test data to Google Cloud Pub/Sub. It's used for triggering the Dataflow pipeline by publishing sample text messages to the Pub/Sub topic.

### `requirements.txt`
Similar to the `requirements.txt` file in the `dataflow/` directory, this file lists the Python package requirements specific to the Pub/Sub component of the project.

## `README.md`
This file serves as documentation for the project. It includes an overview of the project, setup instructions, usage guidelines, and any other relevant information for users and developers.

## `requirements.txt`
This file lists the overall Python package requirements for the entire project. It includes dependencies for both the Dataflow and Pub/Sub components, as well as any other required packages.

## `architecture_diagram.png`
This image file contains the architecture diagram of the project. It provides a visual representation of how the different components of the project interact with each other.
