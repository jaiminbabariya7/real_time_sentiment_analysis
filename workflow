# Project Architecture Explanation

## Data Ingestion (Google Cloud Pub/Sub Topic)
Text data is ingested into the system using Google Cloud Pub/Sub, a scalable and durable messaging service. Publishers publish text messages to a Pub/Sub topic.

## Data Processing with Google Cloud Dataflow
Google Cloud Dataflow processes the incoming text data in real-time. It reads messages from the Pub/Sub topic, performs sentiment analysis using the Natural Language API, and processes the results. Dataflow scales automatically to handle the incoming data.

## Sentiment Analysis
Each incoming text message is passed through the Google Cloud Natural Language API for sentiment analysis. The API provides a sentiment score ranging from -1 (negative) to 1 (positive).

## Output (Optional)
The sentiment analysis results can be stored in a database for further analysis or visualized in real-time on a dashboard using tools like Google Data Studio. This component is optional depending on the project requirements.
